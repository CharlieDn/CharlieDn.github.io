I love Haruhi Suzumiya very much and I like this song!

Blazing on by, there's nothing more that I can do.
渇いた心で駆け抜ける
I'm sorry that I'll never be with you again.
ごめんね何もできなくて
Even though my heavy heart is parched with pain,
痛みを分かち合うことさえ
I know somehow, your sorrow's something I won't see.
あなたは許してくれない
It's my life. I'm moving on and never going back there.
無垢に生きるために振り向かず
But you just turn away,
背中向けて
And leave me on the lonely rail.
去ってしまう　ON THE LONELY RAIL


God knows that I would follow you if that is what you wanted.
私ついていくよ
Take me into all your darkest shadows,
どんな辛い世界の
and you'll see that,
闇の中でさえ
I'm even stronger than you could know.
きっとあなたは輝いて
God knows that
超える未来の果て
I am standing here and you could disappear
弱さ故に
slipping right over the edge of the future.
魂こわされぬように
If I had my way, we'd be together forever.
my　way　重なるよ
Eternally God Bless.
いまふたりに　God bless...

The way you're standing there, I feel as though we're almost one again,
あなたがいて　私がいて
and yet, we're miles apart in time.
ほかの人は消えてしまった
Beneath the pale blue moon,
淡い夢の美しさを
I see your eyes are glistening with so much loathe.
描きながら
It's tearing you apart to be here.
傷跡なぞる

You know it. God knows that,
だから私ついていくよ
I would follow you if that is what you wanted.
どんな辛い世界の
Take me into all your darkest shadows,
闇の中でさえ
and you'll see that I'm even stronger than you could know.
きっとあなたは輝いて
God knows that I am standing here and you could disappear
超える未来の果て 弱さ故に
Slipping right over the edge of the future,
魂こわされぬように
If I had my way, we'd be together forever.
my　way　重なるよ
Eternally God Bless.
いまふたりに　God bless...
